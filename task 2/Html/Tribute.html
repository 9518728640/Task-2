              <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015) 
              was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India 
              from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and 
              studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades
              as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
              Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) 
              and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military 
              missile development efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of
              India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle 
              technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,technical, and  political 
              role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original 
              nuclear test by India in 1974. While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute 
              of Management Shillong,Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 
              27 July 2015, aged 83.Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the 
              funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full 
              state honours. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to 
              a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then 
              in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen 
              Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
              His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the
              now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister
              in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners,with numerous 
              properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy  Marakayar 
              traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the 
              time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka
              who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had involved trading
              groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying 
              pilgrims between the  mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order
              to add to the family's meager income.With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland
              in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over 
              time, apart from the ancestral home.
